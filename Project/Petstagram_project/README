'Petstagram': an app like Instagram but for pets. Interface similiar to Instagram both visually and conceptually: 
create users, upload pictures, tag users, comment, like, etc. This project was done as part of my training.

NOTE: Project is not perfected as it was for training purposes. Deployment on AWS is currently offline.

Backend: 5+ models with all three kinds of relationships applied; class and function based views; 
customized forms; customized user and login/register/logout functionality; public and private part for web-app; customized admin site. 

Frontend: made with templates (HTML & CSS).

Experience gained with: Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, classes and objects, class hierarchies, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism;
iterators and generators, decorators, unit-testing, TDD, SOLID Principles, SSR, etc.
